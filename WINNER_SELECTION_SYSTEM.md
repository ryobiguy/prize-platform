# üèÜ Winner Selection System Documentation

## Overview

The Prize Platform includes a fully automated winner selection system that:
- ‚úÖ Automatically draws winners when prizes end
- ‚úÖ Sends email notifications to winners
- ‚úÖ Prevents duplicate winners
- ‚úÖ Respects minimum entry requirements
- ‚úÖ Provides admin controls and monitoring

---

## üéØ How It Works

### Automated Scheduler

The system runs two automated jobs:

1. **Hourly Prize Check** (Every hour at :00)
   - Scans all prizes that have ended
   - Checks if minimum entry requirements are met
   - **Checks if today is the designated draw day** (e.g., Friday)
   - Automatically draws winners on the correct day
   - Sends email notifications

2. **Daily Status Update** (Every day at midnight)
   - Updates prize statuses (upcoming ‚Üí active ‚Üí ended ‚Üí drawn)
   - Cleans up old data
   - Maintains database integrity

### Draw Day Logic

Each prize has a `drawDay` field (e.g., "Friday"). The system will:
- ‚úÖ Wait until the specified day to draw winners
- ‚úÖ Only draw if minimum entries are met
- ‚úÖ Only draw if the prize has ended
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Prizes wait for their draw day even if they ended earlier in the week

**Example:**
- Prize ends on Tuesday
- Draw day is Friday
- System checks hourly but waits until Friday
- On Friday, winners are drawn automatically

### Winner Selection Algorithm

```javascript
1. Create weighted pool of entries
   - Each user's entries are added to the pool
   - More entries = higher chance of winning
   
2. Draw winners (no duplicates)
   - Randomly select from the pool
   - Remove selected user from pool
   - Repeat until all winners are drawn
   
3. Update database
   - Save winners to prize
   - Update user's win history
   - Mark prize as "drawn"
   
4. Send notifications
   - Email each winner
   - Mark as notified
   - Send admin summary
```

### Automatic Flow:

1. Prize ends
   ‚Üì
2. Hourly scheduler checks
   ‚Üì
3. Minimum entries met?
   ‚Üì YES
4. Is today the draw day? (e.g., Friday)
   ‚Üì YES
5. Draw winners (weighted random)
   ‚Üì
6. Save to database
   ‚Üì
7. Send email notifications
   ‚Üì
8. Mark as notified
   ‚Üì
9. Update prize status to "drawn"

**Note:** If it's not the draw day yet, the system waits and checks again next hour.

## üìß Email Notifications

### Winner Email

Winners receive a beautifully formatted email with:
- üéâ Congratulations message
- üí∞ Prize details (title, value, description)
- üìã Next steps to claim the prize
- üîó Link to their dashboard

### Development Mode

Without SendGrid API key:
- Emails are logged to the console
- All functionality works normally
- Perfect for testing

### Production Mode

With SendGrid API key configured:
- Real emails are sent via SendGrid
- Professional HTML templates
- Delivery tracking

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

Already included in `package.json`:
```bash
npm install
```

Dependencies:
- `nodemailer` - Email sending
- `node-cron` - Scheduled tasks

### 2. Configure Email Service (Optional)

Add to `.env`:
```env
# Email Service (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yoursite.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yoursite.com

# Client URL for email links
CLIENT_URL=https://yoursite.com
```

**Get SendGrid API Key:**
1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com/
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Create new API key with "Mail Send" permissions
4. Copy and paste into `.env`

### 3. System Starts Automatically

The scheduler starts when the server starts:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll see:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB Connected
üéØ Prize Draw Scheduler started
‚è∞ Running hourly prize draw check...
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Prize Model - Winners Array

```javascript
winners: [{
  user: ObjectId,           // Reference to User
  drawnAt: Date,            // When winner was selected
  notified: Boolean         // Email sent successfully
}]
```

### User Model - Wins Array

```javascript
wins: [{
  prize: ObjectId,          // Reference to Prize
  wonAt: Date,              // When user won
  claimed: Boolean          // Prize claimed status
}]
```

---

## üîÑ Prize Status Flow

```
upcoming ‚Üí active ‚Üí ended ‚Üí drawn
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì        ‚Üì       ‚Üì
  Before   During   After   Winners
  start    draw     draw    selected
```

**Status Updates:**
- `upcoming` - Before start date
- `active` - Between start and end date
- `ended` - After end date, no winners yet
- `drawn` - Winners have been selected

---

## üß™ Testing the System

### 1. Create a Test Prize

```javascript
// In MongoDB or via Admin Panel
{
  title: "Test Prize",
  value: 50,
  type: "giftcard",
  startDate: new Date(),
  endDate: new Date(Date.now() + 60000), // 1 minute from now
  minimumEntries: 5,
  totalWinners: 1
}
```

### 2. Add Test Entries

- Create test users
- Have them enter the prize
- Ensure minimum entries are met

### 3. Wait for Draw

**Option A: Wait for scheduler (1 hour)**
- Prize will be drawn automatically
- Check console for logs

**Option B: Manual trigger**
- Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Settings
- Click "Trigger Draw Check Now"
- Instant results

### 4. Verify Results

Check:
- ‚úÖ Winner selected in database
- ‚úÖ Email sent (console or inbox)
- ‚úÖ Prize status = "drawn"
- ‚úÖ User's wins array updated

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### No Winners Being Drawn

**Check:**
1. Prize end date has passed
2. Minimum entries requirement met
3. Prize doesn't already have winners
4. Scheduler is running (check console)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart server to restart scheduler
npm run dev
```

### Emails Not Sending

**Development Mode:**
- Check console for email logs
- Emails won't actually send without API key

**Production Mode:**
- Verify SendGrid API key in `.env`
- Check SendGrid dashboard for errors
- Test with Admin Panel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Test Email

### Duplicate Winners

**This shouldn't happen!** The algorithm prevents duplicates.

If it does:
1. Check the draw logic in `prizeDrawScheduler.js`
2. Verify the `selectedUserIds` Set is working
3. Report the bug with prize details

---
