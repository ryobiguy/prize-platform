# 📅 Draw Day System - Update Summary

## What Changed

The winner selection system has been updated to **respect the designated draw day** for each prize.

### Previous Behavior:
- ❌ Winners drawn immediately when prize ends + minimum entries met
- ❌ No control over when draws happen

### New Behavior:
- ✅ Winners drawn **only on the designated draw day** (e.g., Friday)
- ✅ System waits for the correct day even if prize ended earlier
- ✅ Admins can override and force early draw if needed

---

## How It Works Now

### Automatic Draws

**Example Timeline:**
```
Monday: Prize ends
Tuesday: System checks → "Waiting for Friday"
Wednesday: System checks → "Waiting for Friday"
Thursday: System checks → "Waiting for Friday"
Friday: System checks → "It's Friday! Drawing winners now!" ✅
```

**Console Output:**
```
🎲 Found 1 prize(s) ended. Current day: Tuesday
⏳ Prize "£100 Gift Card" waiting for Friday (today is Tuesday)
```

Then on Friday:
```
🎲 Found 1 prize(s) ended. Current day: Friday
🎯 Drawing winners for: £100 Gift Card (Draw Day: Friday)
✅ Successfully drew 1 winner(s) for "£100 Gift Card"
```

---

## Admin Manual Draw

When an admin tries to draw winners before the draw day:

### Step 1: Initial Attempt
Admin clicks "Draw Winner" button

### Step 2: System Response
```
Error: This prize is scheduled to be drawn on Friday. Today is Tuesday.

The draw will happen automatically on the scheduled day, 
or you can force it now by confirming.

Do you want to force the draw now anyway?
```

### Step 3: Admin Choice
- **Cancel** → Draw waits for Friday
- **Confirm** → Draw happens immediately (override)

---

## Prize Configuration

Each prize has a `drawDay` field:

```javascript
{
  title: "Weekly Prize",
  drawDay: "Friday",  // Can be any day of the week
  endDate: "2025-10-21T23:59:59Z",
  minimumEntries: 50
}
```

**Available Draw Days:**
- Monday
- Tuesday
- Wednesday
- Thursday
- Friday (default)
- Saturday
- Sunday

---

## Code Changes

### 1. Scheduler (`server/services/prizeDrawScheduler.js`)

**Added:**
```javascript
const currentDay = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 
                    'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday'][now.getDay()];

const prizeDrawDay = prize.drawDay || 'Friday';

if (currentDay !== prizeDrawDay) {
  console.log(`⏳ Prize "${prize.title}" waiting for ${prizeDrawDay} (today is ${currentDay})`);
  continue; // Skip this prize for now
}
```

### 2. Admin API (`server/routes/admin.js`)

**Added:**
```javascript
// Check if today is the designated draw day (unless admin forces override)
if (!forceOverride) {
  const currentDay = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', ...][now.getDay()];
  const prizeDrawDay = prize.drawDay || 'Friday';
  
  if (currentDay !== prizeDrawDay) {
    return res.status(400).json({ 
      error: `This prize is scheduled to be drawn on ${prizeDrawDay}...`,
      drawDay: prizeDrawDay,
      currentDay: currentDay
    });
  }
}
```

### 3. Admin Panel (`client/src/pages/AdminPanel.js`)

**Added:**
```javascript
// Check if it's a draw day mismatch
if (errorData?.drawDay && errorData?.currentDay) {
  const confirmOverride = window.confirm(
    `${errorData.error}\n\n${errorData.message}\n\nForce draw now?`
  );
  
  if (confirmOverride) {
    handleDrawWinner(prizeId, true); // Retry with override
  }
}
```

## Migration Notes

### Existing Prizes
- Default `drawDay` is "Friday" if not set
- No database migration needed
- Existing logic still works

### New Prizes
- Set `drawDay` when creating prize
- Choose day that makes sense for your schedule
- Consider user timezone (draws happen server time)

---

## Testing

### Test the Draw Day Logic:

1. **Create test prize:**
   ```javascript
   drawDay: "Friday"
   endDate: new Date() // Ends now
   ```

2. **Check console:**
   ```
   ⏳ Prize "Test" waiting for Friday (today is Tuesday)
   ```

3. **Try manual draw:**
   - Click "Draw Winner"
   - See override prompt
   - Confirm to force draw

4. **Wait for Friday:**
   - System automatically draws
   - No manual intervention needed

---

## Configuration

No additional configuration needed! The system:
- ✅ Uses existing `drawDay` field from Prize model
- ✅ Defaults to "Friday" if not specified
- ✅ Works with current scheduler
- ✅ No breaking changes

---

## Summary

**What you asked for:**
> "I don't want it to automatically draw a winner when minimum requirement is met, draw the run on the Friday coming if minimum requirements are met"

**What was implemented:**
✅ System now waits for the designated draw day (Friday by default)
✅ Checks minimum requirements AND draw day before drawing
✅ Admins can still force early draws if needed
✅ Fully automated with clear logging
✅ No configuration changes required

**Status:** ✅ Complete and tested!

The system is now smarter and respects your draw schedule while maintaining flexibility for admins.
