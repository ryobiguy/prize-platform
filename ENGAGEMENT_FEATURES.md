---

## 💰 Economics

### Monthly Costs:
```
Daily Prizes:   £5 × 30 days  = £150
Weekly Prizes:  £50 × 8 draws = £400
Monthly Prize:  £480 × 1      = £480
─────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                          £1,030
```

### Expected Revenue (100 users):
```
Video Ads:      $225/month
Surveys:        $600/month (if 40% participate)
App Installs:   $300/month (if 30% participate)
Referrals:      $50/month
─────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:          $1,175/month (~£950)
```

### Break-Even Point:
- **Need ~110 active users** to break even
- **At 150 users:** Profitable
- **At 500 users:** $5,000+/month revenue
